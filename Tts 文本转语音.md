To convert text to speech in Python, you can use the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. This library provides a simple way to convert text to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API.



If System.Speech is not available in your environment, you can use the Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech library, which is part of the Azure Cognitive Services. This library can be used to convert text to speech and is available as a NuGet package.
Steps to use Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech

Install the NuGet package:

In Visual Studio, open the Package Manager Console and run:

sh


Copy code


Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech
